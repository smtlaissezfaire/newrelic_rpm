This Agreement is a legal agreement between Licensee and New Relic, Inc. ("New Relic").  This Agreement governs Licensee's use of the New Relic client agent software distributed in source code form with this Agreement, including any updates that may be provided by New Relic to Licensee and any accompanying documentation (collectively, "Software"), to access New Relic's hosted service for the management of Licensee's applications ("Service").

1. BACKGROUND.  New Relic desires to obtain data from Licensee relating to the use and testing of the Software and New Relic's Service.  Licensee understands that the Software and Service have not yet completed New Relic's quality assurance testing.  Licensee is willing to use and evaluate the Software and Service and report on its operations to New Relic, subject to the following terms and conditions.


2. FEEDBACK.  During the Term (as defined in Section 6 below), Licensee agrees to provide New Relic comments, criticisms, suggested improvements, test results, and other feedback regarding the functions, features, and other characteristics of the Software and Service in written or oral form and respond to any questions that New Relic may have from time to time regarding the performance of the Software and Service (collectively, "Feedback").  Licensee hereby grants New Relic a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, fully paid and royalty-free, right to use and exploit the Feedback and related information in any manner and for any purpose.


3. LICENSE; RESTRICTIONS


3.1 License.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, New Relic hereby grants to Licensee, during the Term, a royalty-free, nonexclusive, non-transferable, with no right to modify, license to internally reproduce and use the Software on any number of computers owned by Licensee, for the sole purposes of evaluating the performance and functionality of the Software and Service to manage Licensee's applications.  During the Term, Licensee may permit third party service providers to reproduce and use the Software on computers owned by such third party service providers, provided that (a) such use is limited to the sole purposes of evaluating the performance and functionality of the Software and Service in connection with the management of Licensee's applications, and (b) such use is in compliance with this Agreement, including the restrictions set forth in Section 3.2.  Each person (including Licensee's and Licensee's third party service providers employees) that is authorized by Licensee to access and use the Software and Service on Licensee's behalf is referred to in this Agreement as an "Authorized User." 

3.2 Restrictions.  Licensee agrees that (a) the Software may contain a mechanism to disable use of the Software; (b) Licensee will not interfere with the date and time of any such disabling mechanism; and (c) New Relic shall not be responsible for loss or alteration of programs, data or other information resulting from use of the Software or the disabling mechanism, if any.  Licensee acknowledges that the Software and its structure, organization, and source code constitute valuable trade secrets of New Relic.  Licensee agrees that it will not, and it will not permit any Authorized User to, (i) reproduce, modify, distribute, transfer, disclose, or make available to any third party any portion of the Software or Service in any form except as expressly permitted in Section 3.1; (ii) publish any Feedback or any performance or benchmark tests or analyses relating to the Software, Service, or the use of the foregoing, or (iii) use the Software or Service except as expressly licensed in Section 3.1.  


4. NO SUPPORT.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that New Relic is not required under this Agreement to provide any support services to Licensee with respect to Licensee's use of the Software or Service.  Without limiting the foregoing, upon Licensee's request, New Relic may, at New Relic's sole discretion, provide such support to Licensee.


5. TITLE.  New Relic shall retain all right, title and interest in the Software and Service and in all intellectual property rights to the foregoing.  No license or other rights of any kind are granted or conveyed except for the limited internal license expressly provided herein and all rights not expressly granted herein are reserved to New Relic.  Except as expressly permitted in Section 3.1, Licensee shall not offer, loan, transfer, encumber, sell or otherwise dispose of the Software or Service to any third party without having received prior written authorization from New Relic.  If Licensee does so, the disposal will be deemed void.  


6. COMMUNICATION, SECURITY AND DATA

6.1 Communications.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that New Relic may send Licensee communications regarding the Software, Service, Feedback or Licensee's account via email.  

6.2 Accounts, Passwords, and Security.  Licensee will be assigned a unique user identification name and password to download the Software and for access to and use of the Service ("Licensee ID").  Licensee will assign a unique identification name and password for each Authorized User to access and use the Service and Software ("Authorized User ID").  All Authorized User IDs shall be subject to New Relic's verification that such User IDs are not already in use in New Relic's database.  Licensee shall be responsible for ensuring the security and confidentiality of Licensee ID and all Authorized User IDs.  Licensee will be responsible for all activities conducted under the Licensee ID and each Authorized User ID.  Licensee agrees to maintain a current list of all of its Authorized Users and to notify New Relic of changes to such list.  If Licensee or any Authorized User loses its password, Licensee or the applicable Authorized User may not be able to access the Service.

6.3 Personal Data.  To provide the Software and Service, New Relic may require Licensee and Authorized Users to provide personally identifiable data ("Personal Data").  Licensee grants to New Relic all proprietary rights and licenses in and to Personal Data reasonably necessary for New Relic to provide the Software and Service (if applicable) to Licensee.  Licensee represents and warrants that it has all the rights necessary to grant the licenses granted herein to New Relic in and to such Personal Data and Licensee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless New Relic from any and all losses, costs, damages, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) incurred or arising from any claim by a third party (including Authorized Users) relating to or arising out of a breach of such warranty.  

6.4 Blind Data.  New Relic shall have the right to utilize data capture, syndication, and analysis tools, and other similar tools, to extract, compile, synthesize, and analyze any non-personally identifiable data or information resulting from Licensee's and its Authorized Users' use of the Service ("Blind Data").  To the extent that any Blind Data is collected by New Relic, such Blind Data shall be solely owned by New Relic and may be used by New Relic for any lawful business purpose without a duty of accounting to Licensee, provided that the Blind Data is used only in an aggregated form, without specifically identifying the source of the Blind Data.


7. TERM AND TERMINATION.   The term of this Agreement shall begin on the date Licensee accepts this Agreement, or the date Licensee first installs or uses the Software, whichever first occurs (the "Effective Date").  Unless terminated earlier as allowed for in this Section, this Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of sixty (60) days immediately following the Effective Date or for such longer term as New Relic may grant in writing ("Term").  This Agreement shall terminate immediately and without notice if Licensee breaches any term or condition hereof.  Licensee agrees that any breach of this Agreement by Authorized Users shall be deemed a breach of the Agreement by Licensee.  In addition, New Relic may immediately terminate this Agreement at any time with or without cause upon written notice to Licensee.  Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, the licenses granted hereunder shall terminate immediately and Licensee shall destroy all copies of the Software in its possession or control.  Sections 2, 3.2, 5, 6.4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 shall survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.


8. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  Licensee acknowledges that the Software and Service are pre-production, have not been completely tested and likely contain errors.  New Relic is providing the Software and access to the Service on an "AS IS" basis for use by Licensee and Authorized Users at Licensee's own risk.  NEW RELIC DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  NEW RELIC DOES NOT WARRANT THAT USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.  


9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  LICENSEE AGREES THAT NEW RELIC SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE TO LICENSEE, ITS CUSTOMERS, OR THIRD PARTIES CAUSED BY THE PERFORMANCE OR NONPERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE.  IN NO EVENT WILL NEW RELIC BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, OR INDIRECT DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE, SERVICE, OR OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE FOREGOING OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OTHER CLAIM ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF NEW RELIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  NEW RELIC'S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SOFTWARE, THE SERVICE, AND OTHER MATERIALS PROVIDED ALONG WITH THE FOREGOING, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT OR OTHER LEGAL THEORY, WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($ 100). 


10. CONFIDENTIALITY.  The Software and Service are unannounced and not available to the public.  Providing the Software to Licensee does not constitute a sale or an announcement that the Software, or the Service, or that any other product or service of similar functionality, will be available from New Relic.  New Relic considers the Software, Service and any technical information, evaluation or reports regarding the foregoing supplied to or prepared by Licensee to be proprietary to New Relic and Licensee agrees to treat the Software as confidential in a manner no less protective than Licensee uses to protect its own similar assets, but in no event will Licensee use less than reasonable care to protect the Software.  Licensee agrees to limit access to the Software and Service to those persons who are necessary for Licensee to complete its testing and evaluation of the Software and Service to manage Licensee's applications.  Except as provided herein, Licensee agrees not to permit any third party access to the Software or Service, nor to any materials generated by New Relic or Licensee regarding the Software or Service without New Relic's advance written approval. 


11. GENERAL PROVISIONS.  Licensee agrees to act as a reference account that will provide, upon reasonable request, Software and Service related comments to the press, potential investors, and current or prospective customers.  This Agreement and any action related thereto will be governed and interpreted by and under the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to any conflicts of laws principles that require the application of the law of a different state.  Licensee hereby expressly consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue in the state and federal courts for the county in which New Relic's principal place of business is located for any lawsuit filed there against Licensee by New Relic arising from or related to this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain enforceable, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  This Agreement, and Licensee's rights and obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted, delegated, or otherwise transferred by Licensee without New Relic's prior written consent, and any attempted assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void. The terms of this Agreement shall be binding upon assignees.  Licensee acknowledges that any breach of this Agreement by Licensee would cause irreparable injury to New Relic for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and, therefore, will entitle New Relic to injunctive relief (including specific performance).  The rights and remedies provided to each party in this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies available to such party at law or in equity.  Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion.  Licensee agrees not to export, directly or indirectly, any U.S. technical data acquired from New Relic or any Software utilizing such data, to countries outside the United States, in violation of the United States export laws or regulations.  Any notices required by this Agreement to be sent to Licensee shall be provided to the email address provided by Licensee for its account.  Any notices required by this Agreement to be sent to New Relic shall be provided to: New Relic, Inc., 2480 Sand Hill Rd., Menlo Park, CA 94025 (Attention: New Relic Finance).  Notice will be effective upon receipt or refusal of delivery.  The headings of Sections of this Agreement are for convenience and are not to be used in interpreting this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, the word "including" means "including but not limited to."  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements, written or oral, regarding such subject matter.  Any amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement will be effective only if in writing and signed by the parties.
