=============
NEW RELIC RPM
=============

NewRelic RPM is a Ruby performance management system, developed by New Relic, Inc.
RPM provides you with deep information about the performance of your Ruby on Rails 
or Merb application as it runs in production. The New Relic Agent is distributed as
a either a Rails plugin or a Gem.

Our testing shows that this agent introduces minimal overhead: in production, a
typical controller action will be impacted by less than 5 milliseconds in
response time. (That's significantly less time than is typically spent in mapping
a request to the appropriate controller action.) So, you can run RPM all the
time, and always have access to the information you need to resolve performance
problems and ensure your application can scale to meet the demands of your
business.

The New Relic Agent runs in one of two modes:

DEVELOPER MODE
------------
Developer mode is on by default when you run your application in the development
environment (but not when it runs in other environments.) When running in
developer mode, the RPM will track the performance of every http request serviced
by your application, and store in memory this information for the last 100 http 
transactions.

When running in Developer Mode, the RPM will also add a few pages to 
your application that allow you to analyze this performance information. (Don't 
worry - those pages are not added to your application's routes when you run in 
production mode.)

To view this performance information, including detailed SQL statement analysis,
open '/newrelic' in your web application.  For instance if you are running
mongrel or thin on port 3000, enter the following into your browser:

http://localhost:3000/newrelic

PRODUCTION MODE
---------------
When your application runs in the production environment, the NewRelic agent
runs in production mode. It connects to the New Relic RPM service and sends deep
performance data to the RPM service for your analysis. To view this data, login
to http://rpm.newrelic.com.

NOTE: you must have a valid account and license key to view this data online.
When you sign up for an account at newrelic.com, you will be provided with a
license key, as well as a default configuration file for NewRelic RPM. You can
either paste your license key into your existing configuration file,
config/newrelic.yml, or you can replace that config file with the one included in
your welcome email.

Thank you, and may your application scale to infinity plus one.
