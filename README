NEW RELIC RPM
=============

NewRelic RPM the a rails application performance monitoring system, currently under development by New Relic, Inc.

The NewRelic Agent is installed as a Rails plugin. Configuration is trivial: simply edit a couple of
properties in RAILS_ROOT/config/newrelic.yml. When enabled, the NewRelic Agent will send performance
metrics about your rails application to the newrelic.com, which will collect this data and present
it to you for your analysis. The NewRelic Agent is designed to be extremely lightweight, and yields
exceptionally deep and useful performance information at a very low response time and CPU overhead.
